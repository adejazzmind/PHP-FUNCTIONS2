In PHP, a function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Functions promote code organization, reusability, and readability by encapsulating logic into named blocks that can be called multiple times. They can accept input parameters and return values, making them versatile for various programming tasks. PHP provides both built-in functions and allows users to define their own functions.
